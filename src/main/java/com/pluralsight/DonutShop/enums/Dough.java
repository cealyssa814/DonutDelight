//Resource for learning enums: W3 Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_enums.asp)

//Enum: a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).
//Cannot be used to create objects
//Cannot extend other classes (but it can implement interfaces).

//Why And When To Use Enums?
//-Use enums when you have values that you know aren't going to change, like month days, days, colors, deck of cards, etc.

public enum Dough { YEAST, CAKE, FRITTER, MOCHI } // Donut dough types (custom spec)
